",NO,,NO,,YES," CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION
The American Journal of Psychiatry requires, as a condition of consideration for publication, registration of clinical trials in a public trials registry. Trials must be registered at or before the onset of patient enrollment. For this purpose, a clinical trial is defined as any research project that prospectively assigns human subjects to intervention or comparison groups to study the cause-and-effect relationship between a medical intervention and a health outcome. Studies designed for other purposes, such as to study pharmacokinetics or major toxicity (for example, phase I trials), would be exempt. The Journal does not advocate one particular registry, but requires authors to register their trial in a registry that meets several criteria. The registry must be accessible to the public at no charge. It must be open to all prospective registrants and managed by a not-for-profit organization. There must be a mechanism to ensure the validity of the registration data, and the registry should be electronically searchable.

An acceptable registry must include at minimum the following information: a unique identifying number, a statement of the intervention (or interventions) and comparison (or comparisons) studied, a statement of the study hypothesis, definitions of the primary and secondary outcome measures, eligibility criteria, key trial dates (registration date, anticipated or actual start date, anticipated or actual date of last follow-up, planned or actual date of closure to data entry, and date trial data considered complete), target number of subjects, funding source, and contact information for the principal investigator. To our knowledge, at present, only www.clinicaltrials.gov, sponsored by the United States National Library of Medicine, meets these requirements; there may be other registries, now or in the future, that meet all these requirements. Registration information must be provided in the cover letter at submission.

The clinical trials registration should be included at the end of the abstract. The requirement is that all clinical trials, essentially all phase 2 or later trials in which subjects are assigned to one or more treatment arms, either pharmacological or nonpharmacological, have clinical trials registration. Authors are responsible for having obtained registration before enrolling subjects that specifies the interventions, subject numbers and type, the primary and secondary outcomes, including assessment instruments and intervals, and statistical analysis of results. If the methods and results as described in the article are not fully consistent with the clinical trials registration, then the methods should describe what differed and why, how, and when the decision was made that resulted in the difference. We recognize that other regulatory bodies, such as sponsors, institutional review boards (IRBs), and data and safety monitoring boards (DSMBs), may change trials, and this fact should be noted. If registration was not obtained prior to the start of the trial, then other evidence, such as IRB or grant documents, should be presented to the Editorial Office to document when parameters of the trial were specified. A description of this evidence should be placed in the Methods section. ",NO,,

This  requirement applies to all clinical trials that begin enrollment after  July 1, 2005 and applies to all clinical trials, including Phase 1 
studies. Any research study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related  intervention(s) to evaluate the effects on health outcomes is considered a clinical trial. The special report, The Proposed Rule for U.S. Clinical Trial Registration and Results Submission published in The New England Journal of Medicine, can be consulted for the guidance. Those who are uncertain whether their trial meets the ICMJE definition of a  clinical trial should err on the side of registration if they wish to seek publication.

The registry must be accessible to the public at no charge, searchable, open to all prospective registrants, and managed by a not-for-profit organization. The registry must include the following  information: a unique identifying number, a statement of the  intervention(s), study hypothesis, definition of primary and secondary  outcome measurements, eligibility criteria, target number of subjects,  funding source, contact information for the principal investigator, and  key dates (registration date, start date, and completion date).

The registry sponsored by the United States National Library of Medicine (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) meets these requirements and is recommended by the editors.

Other registries are acceptable if they meet these requirements. In addition to http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, the following registries are recommended by the ICMJE:

In accordance with the ICMJE’s recommendation, we will also accept registration of clinical trials in any of the primary registers that participate in the World Health Organization’s International Clinical  Trial Registry Platform. Primary registers are WHO-selected registers managed by not-for-profit entities that will accept registrations for any interventional trials, delete duplicate entries from their own  register, and provide data directly to the WHO. Please note that  registration in any WHO partner registers is insufficient...

This  requirement applies to all clinical trials that begin enrollment after  July 1, 2005 and applies to all clinical trials, including Phase 1 
studies. Any research study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related  intervention(s) to evaluate the effects on health outcomes is considered a clinical trial. The special report, The Proposed Rule for U.S. Clinical Trial Registration and Results Submission published in The New England Journal of Medicine, can be consulted for the guidance. Those who are uncertain whether their trial meets the ICMJE definition of a  clinical trial should err on the side of registration if they wish to seek publication.

The registry must be accessible to the public at no charge, searchable, open to all prospective registrants, and managed by a not-for-profit organization. The registry must include the following  information: a unique identifying number, a statement of the  intervention(s), study hypothesis, definition of primary and secondary  outcome measurements, eligibility criteria, target number of subjects,  funding source, contact information for the principal investigator, and  key dates (registration date, start date, and completion date).

The registry sponsored by the United States National Library of Medicine (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) meets these requirements and is recommended by the editors.

Other registries are acceptable if they meet these requirements. In addition to http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, the following registries are recommended by the ICMJE:

In accordance with the ICMJE’s recommendation, we will also accept registration of clinical trials in any of the primary registers that participate in the World Health Organization’s International Clinical  Trial Registry Platform. Primary registers are WHO-selected registers managed by not-for-profit entities that will accept registrations for any interventional trials, delete duplicate entries from their own  register, and provide data directly to the WHO. Please note that  registration in any WHO partner registers is insufficient...

In general, P values larger than 0.01 should be reported to two decimal places, and those between 0.01 and 0.001 to three decimal places; P values smaller than 0.001 should be reported as P<0.001. Notable exceptions to this policy include P values arising from tests associated with stopping rules in clinical trials or from genome-wide association studies.
When no method to adjust for multiplicity of inferences or controlling false discovery rate was specified in the protocol or SAP of a clinical trial, the report of all secondary and exploratory endpoints should be limited to point estimates of treatment effects with 95% confidence intervals. In such cases, the Methods section should note that the widths of the intervals have not been adjusted for multiplicity and that the inferences drawn may not be reproducible. No P values should be reported for these analyses.",YES,"Significance tests should be accompanied by confidence intervals for estimated effect sizes, measures of association, or other parameters of interest. The confidence intervals should be adjusted to match any adjustment made to significance levels in the corresponding test.",NO,,YES,The Methods section of all manuscripts should contain a brief description of sample size and power considerations for the study,YES,"Significance tests should be accompanied by confidence intervals for estimated effect sizes, measures of association, or other parameters of interest.

Consider using longitudinal analyses if outcome data were collected at more than 1 time point. Some methodological and reporting options follow. With an appropriate model for longitudinal analysis, you can report differences within groups over time, differences between groups, and differences across groups of their within-group changes over time (usually the key contrast of interest). You can control for any confounding that might emerge, such as a difference in a variable (e.g., body weight) among those who remained in the study until completion. Longitudinal analysis options include a population averaged analysis (generalized estimating equations [GEEs], for example) that estimates the time by treatment interaction and adjusts variance for the repeated measures within individuals over time. Another option is a mixed effects model, with random effects for patient, and the estimate of interest being the time by treatment interaction. In choosing a model, consider whether any missing data are missing at random (i.e., “ignorable” missing data) or missing dependent on the observed data (i.e., informative missing data). In GEE analyses, missing data are assumed to be missing completely at random independent of both observed and unobserved data.

Screening covariates

Approaches that select factors for inclusion in a multivariable model only if the factors are “statistically significant” in “bivariate screening” are not optimal.

Odds ratios and predicted probabilities

Authors often report odds ratios for multivariable results when the odds ratio is difficult to interpret or not meaningful. First, the odds ratio might overstate the effect size when the reference risk is high. For example, if the reference risk is 25% (odds = 0.33) and the odds ratio is 3.0, the relative risk is only 2.0. Statements such as “3-fold increased risk” or “3 times the risk” are incorrect. Second, readers want an easily understood measure of the level of risk (and the confidence intervals) for different groups of patients as defined by treatment, exposure, and covariates. Consider providing a table of predicted probabilities for each of the factors of interest, and confidence intervals of those predicted probabilities. Moreover, a multiway table that cross-classifies predicted probabilities by the most important factor and then adjusts for the remaining factors will often be more meaningful than a table of adjusted odds ratios. Standard commercial software can produce predicted probabilities and confidence bounds.

Hazard Ratios and Standardized Cumulative Incidence

Authors often report results from analysis of survival or time-to-event data using hazard ratios estimated from proportional hazards Cox models. Hazard ratios are notoriously difficult to interpret clinically, may be sensitive to the length of follow-up, and rely on model assumptions, such as proportional hazards. In addition, presenting estimates of effect in both absolute and relative terms increases the likelihood that results will be correctly interpreted. For all of these reasons, we recommend that authors present cumulative incidence curves (inverted Kaplan-Meier plots) along with tabular summaries of absolute differences in cumulative incidence, with 95% confidence bounds, at meaningful times, when reporting results from survival analyses. When such an analysis requires covariate adjustment, authors can estimate and present covariate-standardized (weighted) cumulative incidence curves with differences in adjusted cumulative incidence at meaningful times.

Missing Outcomes

Always report the frequency of missing outcomes and follow-up data, reasons and any patterns for the missing data, and how you handled missing data in the analyses. Do not use a last observation carried forward approach (LOCF) to address incomplete follow-up even if the original protocol prespecified that approach for handling missing data. LOCF approaches understate variability and result in bias. The direction of the bias is not predictable. Although the method of addressing missing data may have little import on findings when the proportion of missing data is small (e.g., <5%), authors should avoid using outdated or biased methods to address incomplete follow-up. Appropriate methods for handling missing data include imputation, pattern-mixture (mixed) models, and selection models. Application of these methods requires consideration of the patterns and potential mechanisms behind the missing data.

In these settings, authors should carry out formal sensitivity analysis to assess how strong an unmeasured confounder would need to be to explain away an observed association. One relatively easy to use method that does not require strong assumptions is the E-value, proposed by VanderWeele and Ding (2017), an article that contains many references, includes a technical appendix, and points to available software. After conducting formal sensitivity, or bias analysis, authors can discuss the likelihood that the reported results are due to residual confounding.

Missing variables

Always report the frequency of missing variables and how the analysis handled missing data. Consider adding a column to tables or a row under figures that makes clear the amount of missing data. Avoid using a simple indicator or dummy variable to represent a missing value. Replacing missing predictors with dummy variables or missing indicators generally leads to biased estimates.

Missing Outcomes

Always report the frequency of missing outcomes and follow-up data, reasons and any patterns for the missing data, and how you handled missing data in the analyses. Do not use a last observation carried forward approach (LOCF) to address incomplete follow-up even if the original protocol prespecified that approach for handling missing data. LOCF approaches understate variability and result in bias. The direction of the bias is not predictable. Although the method of addressing missing data may have little import on findings when the proportion of missing data is small (e.g., <5%), authors should avoid using outdated or biased methods to address incomplete follow-up. Appropriate methods for handling missing data include imputation, pattern-mixture (mixed) models, and selection models. Application of these methods requires consideration of the patterns and potential mechanisms behind the missing data.

Archived data should be sufficiently complete so that subsequent users can (1) reconstruct tables, graphs, and statistical analyses reported in the original publication, and (2) derive summary statistics necessary for new analyses or meta-analyses. Thus, the normal resolution of the data that are archived will be at the level of individual observations. 

Computer Code. Authors must disclose software and statistical procedures used in the manuscript and provide any novel computer code used for models, simulations, or statistical analyses.

Do not describe commonplace statistical tests in Methods, but allude to them briefly in Results.

Statistical and other details should be provided as footnotes rather than appearing in the title.

Authors are free to interpret statistical analyses as they see fit. The author, however, needs to provide the reader with information sufficient for an independent assessment of the analysis. Thus, the assumptions and the model underlying any statistical analysis must be clearly stated, and the presentation of results must be sufficiently detailed.

In addition, the entire ""Statistical analyses and data presentation"" section provides additional information of the journal's ""basic philosophy"" to statistics (beyond what we are coding for)."

Give one leading digit for the p-values and in the case of very small p-values give p<0.0001.

Comparison of p-values: refrain from comparing the size of p-values when, for example, assessing differences for various groups. This needs some extra-testing.",YES,"Please specify the program used, the significance level, and that it is two-sided (which is the rule).

Proving significance of an association – even in a quite complicated model – does not imply causality of the relationship.

Statistical tests offer a rational decision in case of uncertainty. This probabilistic statement is possible only at the price of formality. If your descriptive analysis is in favour of your hypothesis, but the p-value is not significant, you could not prove your case and you should concede this. Even with a p-value 0.05

There are several points to consider:...

p-value is not significant: if the p-value does not reach significance, this is not proof that the scientific hypothesis is not correct. Other factors such as sample size, frequency of the given event or the relative effect size may explain the lack of statistical significance. Whenever a power calculation has been done, a probabilistic statement about the lack of effect can be made.

Significance vs. relevance: a statistically significant result does not imply clinical or scientific relevance even if the p-value is very low. This relevance is a subject-matter decision. In addition to significant p-values it is advisable to give a measure of effect size, in particular for large studies, where effects with little relevance may become statistically significant. The boundaries of a confidence interval may also be useful to assess relevance of potential effects.",NO,,YES,"For clinical trials a power analysis to justify the number of subjects included is indispensable, but is also desirable for other studies.

Only compare groups which are comparable: If groups are unequal in relevant aspects such as age, some measure reflecting the group differences should be used when testing e.g. for therapeutic differences. This can be done by using covariates or a propensity score. When reporting a study that uses a propensity score, the Methods section should include a description of the type of propensity analysis (matching, stratification etc), what covariates were used in the propensity score and whether balance was achieved with the propensity score.

[ALSO THE ENTIRE MODEL SECTION]

Model Building
Often, the goals necessitate a model building step. This can be a classical quantitative regression where the outcome is continuous and approximately normally distributed, and where the predictors are pretty straightforward. But more often the outcome is binary or time to event data, where logistic and survival models (including the Cox model) are used. Whatever the type of regression, the choice of predictors can be complex, yet is a crucial step in the analysis. Therefore, this step needs some elaboration in the manuscript.

In particular, authors should avoid automated stepwise procedures to select a set of predictors. Such procedures have a tendency to include spurious predictors or to miss influential predictors. Also the results are not transportable to similar data sets, since the set of predictors is random. Furthermore, bivariate screening of covariates is discouraged (Sun et al. 1996, J Clin Epidemiol 49: 907-16). External clinical judgment is ideal for selection of predictors and results from the literature are also worthwhile. Otherwise model averaging or penalized maximum likelihood methods are considered appropriate model selection procedures. There are various statistical strategies to assess model choice and performance, bootstrapping being a prominent example. For more information see papers by Harrell and others in the statistical literature (e.g. Stat Med 1996, 15:361-387). The authors should specify all variables initially considered as candidates for the model and the approach they adopted to derive the final model. The choice of confounders might be less critical than the choice of truly explanatory variables.

Various model assumptions need to be checked: for multiple linear regression residual analysis should be used to check for approximate normality and linearity. For Cox regression the proportionality assumption should be checked.

The modelling of repeated data – repeated within person – can be demanding. This occurs when there are one or more follow-ups, or when recordings are made at more than one location etc. These within-person data are correlated. Modeling such data would be easier if the correlations were all of the same size (‘compound symmetry assumption’). However, this is rarely the case, since correlations become lower with increasing distance (in time or location). In an ANOVA setting one has, in this case, to perform a Greenhouse-Geisser correction of p-values. For various designs there are other methods to analyze longitudinal data, which are not only statistically correct, but also offer more information about the development of some variable and group compared to a purely cross-sectional analysis. In the simple case of one follow-up, use the paired t-test or the Wilcoxon signed rank test instead of their two-sample analogs.

Another data setting which needs some care are clustered data. Examples include varying number of lesions under study per subject, and a varying number of family members when families are at stake etc. Again, one has a correlation structure for the within data as for repeated data, but the number of repetitions is itself random. Possibilities to analyze such data include mixed linear modeling, with the cluster as a random effect, or more broadly generalized estimating equations. As for repeated data, a professional statistician should usually be involved with this type of study. In a case where one has 270 stents for 250 patients, a patient-wise analysis is pragmatically indicated, taking one stent per patient.

Meeting assumptions for testing: The t-test and many other tests assume approximately normally distributed data. This has to be checked from one’s own data or via the literature. Checking can be done graphically (box plots, histograms), by computing skewness and kurtosis or by applying the Shapiro-Wilk test, and there are other means to do so. In simple situations with non-normal data, one can use a non-parametric test for non-normal data (e.g. a Mann-Whitney test instead of the two-sample t-test). If this is not possible one should consider an appropriate transformation of the data to achieve approximate normality (the log-transformation is just one prominent example). Often the transformed scale offers advantages in terms of variability and/or interpretation. Please consult a professional statistician.

Selection of Chi-square vs. Fisher’s exact test (or other variants of exact tests for cross-tables): For categorical data, statistical testing is often done with a Chi-square test.

Exception: some statisticians argue that two-group comparisons can be used on multigroup data if the expected outcomes are appropriately anticipated before the experiment.

Submission and format requirements for Registered Report Protocols and Registered Reports are similar to those for a regular submission and may be specific to your study type. For instance, if your Registered Report Protocol submission is about a Clinical Trial or a Systematic Review, follow the appropriate guidelines.

For Registered Report Protocols:

    Provide enough methodological detail to make the study reproducible and replicable
    Confirm that data will be made available upon study completion in keeping with the PLOS Data policy​
    Include ethical approval or waivers, if applicable
    Preliminary or pilot data may be included, but only if necessary to support the feasibility of the study or as a proof of principle 
    For meta-analyses or Clinical Trials, use the protocol-specific reporting guidelines PRISMA-P or SPIRIT respectively

For more guidance on format and presentation of a protocol, consult the sample template hosted by the Open Science Framework. Discipline-specific and study-specific templates are also available.

For Registered Report Research Articles:

    Report the results of all planned analyses and, if relevant, detail and justify all deviations from the protocol. 
    The manuscript may also contain exploratory, unplanned analyses.

Nature Research journals support study pre-registration (including clinical trials) and pre-registration of analysis plans in public repositories; details of pre-registration should be provided with submission.

Registered Reports, a research article format intended to reduce publication bias and increase methodological rigour is available at Nature Human Behaviour and for select disciplines at Nature Communications. Registered Reports involves a two-stage peer review approach where methods and analysis are pre-registered and peer reviewed before carrying out the intended research.

For most studies, P values should follow the reporting of comparisons of absolute numbers or rates and measures of uncertainty (eg, 0.8%, 95% CI −0.2% to 1.8%; P = .13). P values should never be presented alone without the data that are being compared. If P values are reported, follow standard conventions for decimal places: for P values less than .001, report as ""P<.001""; for P values between .001 and .01, report the value to the nearest thousandth; for P values greater than or equal to .01, report the value to the nearest hundredth; and for P values greater than .99, report as ""P>.99."" For studies with exponentially small P values (eg, genetic association studies), P values may be reported with exponents (eg, P = 1×10−5).

For randomized trials, a statement of the power or sample size calculation is required (see the EQUATOR Network CONSORT Guidelines).

For example,
normalization to matched controls will generate a control
mean of 1 and no SEM, meaning that parametric tests
(ANOVA, etc.) cannot be used (only non-parametric analysis
is acceptable). Any dataset where one group has no SEM

non-parametric statistics. Following data transformation,
the Y axis is often labelled incorrectly (it should be ‘fold
matched control values’ or ‘fold of the control mean’,
and not ‘fold control’).

FIGURE 2 CAPTION:
Parametric versus non-parametric. Individual data points (circles), mean values (x) and SEM values are shown. In panel A, two datasets derived
from an analysis (e.g. Western blotting) where each drug experiment included a matched (contemporaneous) control. A common practice is
for each drug value to be normalized to each matched control value. This means that the controlmean is 1, and there is no variance in the control.
The correct way to analyse these data is using a non-parametric statistical test, and the correct label for the Y axis is ‘fold matched control’. Because
analysis is non-parametric, it is misleading to show the parameter SEM. In panel B, each control and each drug value has been ‘normalized’ to the
mean value of the control group (mean values shown as x). In other words, each raw value has been divided by the value of the mean of the control
values. This generates a Gaussian dataset that can be analysed by parametric statistics (provided the variance is similar in the two groups - a ttest
may falsely identify a nonsignificant difference if the two SEM values differ greatly - see Figure 3), and if so, it is appropriate to show the SEM
(error bars in the figure). However, there is actually no benefit in making this transformation since the ratio between each mean and each SEM is
the same as the equivalent ratios for the raw data. In other words, this ‘transformation’ is identical to a relabelling or rescaling of the Y axis from the
absolute raw values to new values for which the control mean value is relabelled as ‘1’. This has no effect on the ability of the parametric statistical
test to detect a significant difference. However, readers have a tendency to make ‘eyeball’ comparisons between normalized datasets in the same
paper or indeed fromone paper to the next, and this may lead to false inferences. Thus, use of the normalization shown in panel A or presentation
of the raw data (in units that may be arbitrary if this is the case) is preferred, although we acknowledge that for quantitative PCR, the ‘transformation’
depicted in panel B represents common practice at the present time. We also remind authors to ensure that whatever normalization is chosen,
the Y axis is labelled correctly (fold control is not correct) and the appropriate type of statistical test is used.

With small group sizes (n < 12) this may be impossible. It is feasible to define an outlier in a control population as a value that lies outside a defined range, but only if the distribution of values is well defined. This requires a very large group size.

If it is possible to define an outlier, then the next question to address is: why is a value an outlier? The reason may be that the value is false, contaminated or in some other way incorrect. On the other hand, it may be correct, and the result of a natural wide spread of data, or even a bimodal distribution of data. The latter would arise, for example, if one were to analyse readouts in a population that expresses a polymorphism, such as a deficiency in acetylcholinesterase in a small section of the human population. Excluding such outlier values or subjects is justified only in an experiment defined to be relevant only to the larger population, for instance, in the acetylcholinesterase example, those with typical enzyme activity. It is therefore essential to know what the explanation is for an outlier, since it is inappropriate to exclude correct values just because they alter the data distribution.

Genuinely false values should be excluded from a sample, but this must be done using predefined criteria. Using a formula based on the standard deviation is one. A number of others are available in routinely used statistical packages, but their use can be problematic (Leys et al., 2013). Alternatively, one may use an arbitrary limit of acceptability (e.g. to exclude animals whose surgery has lowered blood pressure to below a value appropriate for testing drug effects especially, in this example, effects on blood pressure). This approach is acceptable to BJP, but exclusion criteria should be defined beforehand and applied on blinded data to avoid bias. Exclusion criteria should be fully described in Methods.

With a novel type of study (i.e. where there are no historical controls and database of records with which to consult), it is essential to ensure unbiased quality control, which means undertaking preliminary studies in order to allow generation of arbitrary exclusion criteria, keeping in mind that the justification cannot be ‘scientific’, merely pragmatic (to ensure that data can be analysed statistically without the need for onerously large group sizes). It is wise to revisit any criteria as new data emerge. We encourage authors to include in the manuscript any data that updates their previous exclusion criteria.

When it is impossible to justify reasons for exclusion of data, the best solution is to include all data including any apparent ‘outliers’ and ensure group sizes are large (increased by 50% from the value determined by power analysis is advisable). When inclusion of outliers is decided to be the best option, this may generate non‐Gaussian datasets. These can be modified by use of transformations or processed using non‐parametric statistical tests, as discussed above.

In summary, outliers should be included in a data set unless a predefined and defensible set of exclusion criteria can be generated and applied.",NO,,NO,,NO,,YES,"Statistical analysis does not guarantee that a finding is
necessarily correct, and we will allow an author the right
to argue that a false positive or a false negative finding
may have been generated. This issue is particularly relevant
to variables of secondary interest. Clearly, group size should
be determined a priori such that an expected effect on the
variable of primary interest can easily be detected using
the predefined P threshold (we refer readers to our advice
on determining group sizes). However, such group sizes
may be insufficient for reliable detection of effects on secondary
and subsidiary variables. It is the responsibility of
the author to explain this in the paper, especially if they
wish to argue that an apparent lack of effect was due to a
type 2 error (false negative).",YES,"Exceptions to these guidelines will be considered (e.g., normalised data analysed parametrically without a preceding ANOVA arising from unbalanced experiments with low n in treatment groups) for a result where a full description of the intended experimental design and analysis have been published in a date-stamped, peer-reviewed preclinical registry together with a priori sample size calculations for each group involving adequate power (e.g. Registered Reports; https://cos.io/rr/).",NO,,

Submitting authors are also asked to explain why they believe that the sample sizes in the studies they report were appropriate. Bakker et al. (2016) reported evidence that many published research psychologists have faulty intuitions regarding statistical power. Over the past 50 years, many psychologists have conducted large numbers of studies with low statistical power and submitted for publication those studies that obtained statistically significant results (Cohen, 1969). That practice leads to exaggerated estimates of effect size. Indeed, when statistical power is very low, only results that exaggerate the true size of an effect can be statistically significant. Therefore, it is typically not appropriate to base sample size solely on the sample sizes and/or effect sizes reported in prior research or on the results of small pilot studies (see, e.g., Gelman & Carlin, 2014). There is no single right answer to this question, but authors must explain (in the submission portal and in the manuscript) why they believe their sample size is appropriate. If an estimate of the size of an effect is given, the unit of measurement (e.g., Cohen’s d) must be specified and some rationale for believing that the estimate is sound must be provided. If the study tests more than one effect, authors must make clear which of those effects their power analysis was based upon.

Note that “theoretical significance” differs from “surprising novelty.” Indeed, surprising effects are subject to particularly careful scrutiny.  A direct replication that yields compelling evidence for (or against) a theoretically important but empirically uncertain phenomenon might well meet the “theoretical significance” criterion.

Guidelines for Reporting fMRI Data
Studies involving fMRI or other neuroimaging methods typically entail much larger numbers of measures than those found in behavioral research. Analyses of neuroimaging data have their own well-developed statistical frameworks and reporting standards. We recognize that the focus of fMRI analyses is often not on effect sizes, but rather on (a) statistical reliability and (b) replicability. We refer authors to Poldrack et al. (2008) for a useful list of reporting guidelines for such analyses.

P values should never be presented alone without the data that are being compared. If P values are reported, follow standard conventions for decimal places: for P values less than .001, report as ""P<.001""; for P values between .001 and .01, report the value to the nearest thousandth; for P values greater than or equal to .01, report the value to the nearest hundredth; and for P values greater than .99, report as ""P>.99."" For studies with exponentially small P values (eg, genetic association studies), P values may be reported with exponents (eg, P = 1×10−5).

For randomized trials using parallel-group design, there is no validity in conducting hypothesis tests regarding the distribution of baseline covariates between groups; by definition, these differences are due to chance. Because of this, tables of baseline participant characteristics should not include P values or statements of statistical comparisons among randomized groups. Instead, report clinically meaningful imbalances between groups, along with potential adjustments for those imbalances in multivariable models.
