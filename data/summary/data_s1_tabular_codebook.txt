Project title: A cross-disciplinary assessment of statistical guidance offered to authors by influential scientific journals

This codebook documents the dataset data_s1_tabular.csv

Description: This dataset contains summary level data for Study One, specifically the number of journals overall (N = 330) and in each scientific domain (n = 15 per domain) for each measured variable including:

Provides any statistical guidance
External statistical guidance
Provides journal-specific statistical guidance
Dedicated statistical guidance section

And the twenty prespecified statistical topics.

The dataset is the equivalent tabular data for what is displayed in Figures 1-6 of the manuscript. There is one row per variable and one column per scientific domain (plus an overall column pertaining to all 330 journals across domains).

Source: The original primary data (see data_coding.csv) was preprocessed/reformatted with R code (see manuscript.Rmd).
