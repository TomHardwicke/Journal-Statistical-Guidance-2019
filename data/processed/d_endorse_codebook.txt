*Data codebook*

Project title: Statistical guidance to authors at top-ranked scientific journals:
A cross-disciplinary assessment

This codebook documents the datasets d_endorse.csv and d_endorse.rds
The contents of these two datasets is the same - we are sharing in two formats so users can choose whether to use the csv file or the rds file as they prefer.

Description: This dataset contains preprocessed data for Study One endorsement classifications. There is one row for each journal that mentioned at least one of the six 'hot' statistical topics.

Source: The data file was created from the primary data file data_endorsements.csv via the script preprocessing.R
