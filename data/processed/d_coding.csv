The American Journal of Psychiatry requires, as a condition of consideration for publication, registration of clinical trials in a public trials registry. Trials must be registered at or before the onset of patient enrollment. For this purpose, a clinical trial is defined as any research project that prospectively assigns human subjects to intervention or comparison groups to study the cause-and-effect relationship between a medical intervention and a health outcome. Studies designed for other purposes, such as to study pharmacokinetics or major toxicity (for example, phase I trials), would be exempt. The Journal does not advocate one particular registry, but requires authors to register their trial in a registry that meets several criteria. The registry must be accessible to the public at no charge. It must be open to all prospective registrants and managed by a not-for-profit organization. There must be a mechanism to ensure the validity of the registration data, and the registry should be electronically searchable.

An acceptable registry must include at minimum the following information: a unique identifying number, a statement of the intervention (or interventions) and comparison (or comparisons) studied, a statement of the study hypothesis, definitions of the primary and secondary outcome measures, eligibility criteria, key trial dates (registration date, anticipated or actual start date, anticipated or actual date of last follow-up, planned or actual date of closure to data entry, and date trial data considered complete), target number of subjects, funding source, and contact information for the principal investigator. To our knowledge, at present, only www.clinicaltrials.gov, sponsored by the United States National Library of Medicine, meets these requirements; there may be other registries, now or in the future, that meet all these requirements. Registration information must be provided in the cover letter at submission.

The clinical trials registration should be included at the end of the abstract. The requirement is that all clinical trials, essentially all phase 2 or later trials in which subjects are assigned to one or more treatment arms, either pharmacological or nonpharmacological, have clinical trials registration. Authors are responsible for having obtained registration before enrolling subjects that specifies the interventions, subject numbers and type, the primary and secondary outcomes, including assessment instruments and intervals, and statistical analysis of results. If the methods and results as described in the article are not fully consistent with the clinical trials registration, then the methods should describe what differed and why, how, and when the decision was made that resulted in the difference. We recognize that other regulatory bodies, such as sponsors, institutional review boards (IRBs), and data and safety monitoring boards (DSMBs), may change trials, and this fact should be noted. If registration was not obtained prior to the start of the trial, then other evidence, such as IRB or grant documents, should be presented to the Editorial Office to document when parameters of the trial were specified.

This  requirement applies to all clinical trials that begin enrollment after  July 1, 2005 and applies to all clinical trials, including Phase 1 
studies. Any research study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related  intervention(s) to evaluate the effects on health outcomes is considered a clinical trial. The special report, The Proposed Rule for U.S. Clinical Trial Registration and Results Submission published in The New England Journal of Medicine, can be consulted for the guidance. Those who are uncertain whether their trial meets the ICMJE definition of a  clinical trial should err on the side of registration if they wish to seek publication.

The registry must be accessible to the public at no charge, searchable, open to all prospective registrants, and managed by a not-for-profit organization. The registry must include the following  information: a unique identifying number, a statement of the  intervention(s), study hypothesis, definition of primary and secondary  outcome measurements, eligibility criteria, target number of subjects,  funding source, contact information for the principal investigator, and  key dates (registration date, start date, and completion date).

The registry sponsored by the United States National Library of Medicine (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) meets these requirements and is recommended by the editors.

Other registries are acceptable if they meet these requirements. In addition to http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, the following registries are recommended by the ICMJE:

http://isrctn.orghttp://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/index/htm/http://www.anzctr.org.au/Default.aspxhttp://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/index.asp

In accordance with the ICMJE’s recommendation, we will also accept registration of clinical trials in any of the primary registers that participate in the World Health Organization’s International Clinical  Trial Registry Platform. Primary registers are WHO-selected registers managed by not-for-profit entities that will accept registrations for any interventional trials, delete duplicate entries from their own  register, and provide data directly to the WHO. Please note that  registration in any WHO partner registers is insufficient...

The authors will be requested to provide the exact URL and unique identification number for the trial registration at the time of  submission. Since this information will be published, we ask that you 
include the phrase “Clinical Trial Registration Information” at the end  of the abstract. Please list the URL, as well as the unique identifier,  for the publicly accessible web site on which the trial is registered in  this section.",FALSE,NA

Screening covariates

Approaches that select factors for inclusion in a multivariable model only if the factors are “statistically significant” in “bivariate screening” are not optimal. A factor can be a confounder even if it is not statistically significant by itself because it changes the effect of the exposure of interest when it is included in the model, or because it is a confounder only when included with other covariates.

If several risk factors for disease are considered in a logistic regression model and some of these risk factors are measured with error, the point and interval estimates of relative risk corresponding to any of these factors may be biased either toward or away from the null value; the direction of bias is never certain. In addition to potentially biased estimates, confidence intervals of correctly adjusted estimates will be wider, sometime substantially, than naïve confidence intervals.

Authors should report results for meaningful metrics rather than reporting raw results. For example, rather than reporting the log odds ratio from a logistic regression, authors should transform coefficients into the appropriate measure of effect size, odds ratio, relative risk, or risk difference. Estimates, such as an odds ratio or relative risk, should not be reported for a 1-unit change in the factor of interest if a 1-unit change lacks clinical meaning (age, mm Hg of blood pressure, or any other continuous or interval measurement with small units). All estimates should reflect a clinically meaningful change, along with 95% confidence bounds.

Odds ratios and predicted probabilities

Authors often report odds ratios for multivariable results when the odds ratio is difficult to interpret or not meaningful. First, the odds ratio might overstate the effect size when the reference risk is high. For example, if the reference risk is 25% (odds = 0.33) and the odds ratio is 3.0, the relative risk is only 2.0. Statements such as “3-fold increased risk” or “3 times the risk” are incorrect. Second, readers want an easily understood measure of the level of risk (and the confidence intervals) for different groups of patients as defined by treatment, exposure, and covariates. Consider providing a table of predicted probabilities for each of the factors of interest, and confidence intervals of those predicted probabilities. Moreover, a multiway table that cross-classifies predicted probabilities by the most important factor and then adjusts for the remaining factors will often be more meaningful than a table of adjusted odds ratios. Standard commercial software can produce predicted probabilities and confidence bounds.

Hazard Ratios and Standardized Cumulative Incidence

Authors often report results from analysis of survival or time-to-event data using hazard ratios estimated from proportional hazards Cox models. Hazard ratios are notoriously difficult to interpret clinically, may be sensitive to the length of follow-up, and rely on model assumptions, such as proportional hazards. In addition, presenting estimates of effect in both absolute and relative terms increases the likelihood that results will be correctly interpreted. For all of these reasons, we recommend that authors present cumulative incidence curves (inverted Kaplan-Meier plots) along with tabular summaries of absolute differences in cumulative incidence, with 95% confidence bounds, at meaningful times, when reporting results from survival analyses. When such an analysis requires covariate adjustment, authors can estimate and present covariate-standardized (weighted) cumulative incidence curves with differences in adjusted cumulative incidence at meaningful times.

7. Sensitivity Analysis and Unmeasured Confounding

Analyses of observational data that attempt to assess causality between an exposure and an outcome are generally subject to confounding due to unmeasured or omitted covariates. In these settings, authors should carry out formal sensitivity analysis to assess how strong an unmeasured confounder would need to be to explain away an observed association. One relatively easy to use method that does not require strong assumptions is the E-value, proposed by VanderWeele and Ding (2017), an article that contains many references, includes a technical appendix, and points to available software. After conducting formal sensitivity, or bias analysis, authors can discuss the likelihood that the reported results are due to residual confounding.

Missing variables

Always report the frequency of missing variables and how the analysis handled missing data. Consider adding a column to tables or a row under figures that makes clear the amount of missing data.

Missing Outcomes

Always report the frequency of missing outcomes and follow-up data, reasons and any patterns for the missing data, and how you handled missing data in the analyses. Do not use a last observation carried forward approach (LOCF) to address incomplete follow-up even if the original protocol prespecified that approach for handling missing data. LOCF approaches understate variability and result in bias. The direction of the bias is not predictable. Although the method of addressing missing data may have little import on findings when the proportion of missing data is small (e.g., <5%), authors should avoid using outdated or biased methods to address incomplete follow-up. Appropriate methods for handling missing data include imputation, pattern-mixture (mixed) models, and selection models. Application of these methods requires consideration of the patterns and potential mechanisms behind the missing data.

Proving significance of an association – even in a quite complicated model – does not imply causality of the relationship.

Statistical tests offer a rational decision in case of uncertainty. This probabilistic statement is possible only at the price of formality. If your descriptive analysis is in favour of your hypothesis, but the p-value is not significant, you could not prove your case and you should concede this. Even with a p-value 0.05

There are several points to consider:...

p-value is not significant: if the p-value does not reach significance, this is not proof that the scientific hypothesis is not correct. Other factors such as sample size, frequency of the given event or the relative effect size may explain the lack of statistical significance. Whenever a power calculation has been done, a probabilistic statement about the lack of effect can be made.

Significance vs. relevance: a statistically significant result does not imply clinical or scientific relevance even if the p-value is very low. This relevance is a subject-matter decision.

The majority of papers published in BJP contain data sets
where several test groups are compared with a control
group in order to examine whether a drug has ‘an effect’.

Parametric versus non-parametric. Individual data points (circles), mean values (x) and SEM values are shown. In panel A, two datasets derived
from an analysis (e.g. Western blotting) where each drug experiment included a matched (contemporaneous) control. A common practice is
for each drug value to be normalized to each matched control value. This means that the controlmean is 1, and there is no variance in the control.
The correct way to analyse these data is using a non-parametric statistical test, and the correct label for the Y axis is ‘fold matched control’. Because
analysis is non-parametric, it is misleading to show the parameter SEM. In panel B, each control and each drug value has been ‘normalized’ to the
mean value of the control group (mean values shown as x). In other words, each raw value has been divided by the value of the mean of the control
values. This generates a Gaussian dataset that can be analysed by parametric statistics (provided the variance is similar in the two groups - a ttest
may falsely identify a nonsignificant difference if the two SEM values differ greatly - see Figure 3), and if so, it is appropriate to show the SEM
(error bars in the figure). However, there is actually no benefit in making this transformation since the ratio between each mean and each SEM is
the same as the equivalent ratios for the raw data. In other words, this ‘transformation’ is identical to a relabelling or rescaling of the Y axis from the
absolute raw values to new values for which the control mean value is relabelled as ‘1’. This has no effect on the ability of the parametric statistical
test to detect a significant difference. However, readers have a tendency to make ‘eyeball’ comparisons between normalized datasets in the same
paper or indeed fromone paper to the next, and this may lead to false inferences. Thus, use of the normalization shown in panel A or presentation
of the raw data (in units that may be arbitrary if this is the case) is preferred, although we acknowledge that for quantitative PCR, the ‘transformation’
depicted in panel B represents common practice at the present time. We also remind authors to ensure that whatever normalization is chosen,
the Y axis is labelled correctly (fold control is not correct) and the appropriate type of statistical test is used.

[authors should ensure that] Inclusion and/or exclusion criteria are clearly defined in the Methods @@@@ Genuinely false values should be excluded from a sample,
but this must be done using predefined criteria. Using a formula
based on the standard deviation is one. A number of

one may use an arbitrary limit of acceptability (e.g. to
exclude animals whose surgery has lowered blood pressure
to below a value appropriate for testing drug effects especially,
in this example, effects on blood pressure). This approach is
acceptable to BJP, but exclusion criteria should be defined beforehand
and applied on blinded data to avoid bias. Exclusion
criteria should be fully described in Methods.
With a novel type of study (i.e. where there are no historical
controls and database of records with which to consult),
it is essential to ensure unbiased quality control, which
means undertaking preliminary studies in order to allow generation
of arbitrary exclusion criteria, keeping in mind that

ensure that data can be analysed statistically without the
need for onerously large group sizes). It is wise to revisit any
criteria as new data emerge. We encourage authors to include
in the manuscript any data that updates their previous exclusion
criteria.

These tests should be appropriate for the type (distribution) of data being analysed. Examples of such tests include Grubb’s or ROUT outlier tests. Where outliers are identified a clear indication of number of data points excluded must be provided with a robust explanation for the type of test used. @@@@ Outliers are data values that diverge from the central tendency. An outlier may be a rogue value or part of the innate data distribution. Several aspects of the data distribution may need to be considered before an investigator can decide how to deal with outliers. It is possible to define an outlier in a control population, but only if a large number of control values are available for evaluation. Outliers should therefore be included in data analysis and presentation unless a predefined and defensible set of exclusion criteria can be generated and applied. @@@@ Experimental outliers

We have introduced new guidelines on how to manage experimental outliers, which are defined as values that digress from the central tendency (or ‘central location’). There are several issues that need to be considered before an investigator can decide how to deal with outliers. First, how does one identify an outlier? With small group sizes (n < 12) this may be impossible. It is feasible to define an outlier in a control population as a value that lies outside a defined range, but only if the distribution of values is well defined. This requires a very large group size.

If it is possible to define an outlier, then the next question to address is: why is a value an outlier? The reason may be that the value is false, contaminated or in some other way incorrect. On the other hand, it may be correct, and the result of a natural wide spread of data, or even a bimodal distribution of data. The latter would arise, for example, if one were to analyse readouts in a population that expresses a polymorphism, such as a deficiency in acetylcholinesterase in a small section of the human population. Excluding such outlier values or subjects is justified only in an experiment defined to be relevant only to the larger population, for instance, in the acetylcholinesterase example, those with typical enzyme activity. It is therefore essential to know what the explanation is for an outlier, since it is inappropriate to exclude correct values just because they alter the data distribution.

Genuinely false values should be excluded from a sample, but this must be done using predefined criteria. Using a formula based on the standard deviation is one. A number of others are available in routinely used statistical packages, but their use can be problematic (Leys et al., 2013).

Psychological Science recommends the use of the “new statistics”—effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis—to avoid problems associated with null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST). Authors are encouraged to consult this Psychological Science tutorial by Geoff Cumming, which argues that estimation and meta-analysis are more informative than NHST and that they foster development of a cumulative, quantitative discipline. Cumming has also prepared a video workshop on the new statistics that can be found here.",TRUE,"Submitting authors are also asked to explain why they believe that the sample sizes in the studies they report were appropriate. Bakker et al. (2016) reported evidence that many published research psychologists have faulty intuitions regarding statistical power. Over the past 50 years, many psychologists have conducted large numbers of studies with low statistical power and submitted for publication those studies that obtained statistically significant results (Cohen, 1969). That practice leads to exaggerated estimates of effect size. Indeed, when statistical power is very low, only results that exaggerate the true size of an effect can be statistically significant. Therefore, it is typically not appropriate to base sample size solely on the sample sizes and/or effect sizes reported in prior research or on the results of small pilot studies (see, e.g., Gelman & Carlin, 2014). There is no single right answer to this question, but authors must explain (in the submission portal and in the manuscript) why they believe their sample size is appropriate. If an estimate of the size of an effect is given, the unit of measurement (e.g., Cohen’s d) must be specified and some rationale for believing that the estimate is sound must be provided. If the study tests more than one effect, authors must make clear which of those effects their power analysis was based upon.",TRUE,"Psychological Science recommends the use of the “new statistics”—effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis—to avoid problems associated with null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST)... Please report 95% confidence intervals instead of standard deviations or standard errors around mean dependent variables, because confidence intervals convey more useful information—another point discussed in Cumming’s tutorial.",TRUE,"Psychological Science recommends the use of the “new statistics”—effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis—to avoid problems associated with null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST)...Authors must include effect sizes for their major results and distributional information in their graphs (or tables, for that matter). Fine-grained graphical presentations that show how data are distributed are often the most honest way of communicating results. Please report 95% confidence intervals instead of standard deviations or standard errors around mean dependent variables, because confidence intervals convey more useful information—another point discussed in Cumming’s tutorial.

Guidelines for Reporting fMRI Data
...We recognize that the focus of fMRI analyses is often not on effect sizes, but rather on (a) statistical reliability and (b) replicability. We refer authors to Poldrack et al. (2008) for a useful list of reporting guidelines for such analyses.

Use means and standard deviations (SDs) for normally distributed data and medians and ranges or interquartile ranges (IQRs) for data that are not normally distributed. Avoid solely reporting the results of statistical hypothesis testing, such as P values, which fail to convey important quantitative information. For most studies, P values should follow the reporting of comparisons of absolute numbers or rates and measures of uncertainty (eg, 0.8%, 95% CI −0.2% to 1.8%; P = .13). P values should never be presented alone without the data that are being compared. If P values are reported, follow standard conventions for decimal places: for P values less than .001, report as ""P<.001""; for P values between .001 and .01, report the value to the nearest thousandth; for P values greater than or equal to .01, report the value to the nearest hundredth; and for P values greater than .99, report as ""P>.99."" For studies with exponentially small P values (eg, genetic association studies), P values may be reported with exponents (eg, P = 1×10−5). In general, there is no need to present the values of test statistics (eg, F statistics or χ² results) and degrees of freedom when reporting results.

For randomized trials using parallel-group design, there is no validity in conducting hypothesis tests regarding the distribution of baseline covariates between groups; by definition, these differences are due to chance. Because of this, tables of baseline participant characteristics should not include P values or statements of statistical comparisons among randomized groups. Instead, report clinically meaningful imbalances between groups, along with potential adjustments for those imbalances in multivariable models.
