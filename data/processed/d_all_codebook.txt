*Data codebook*

Project title: Statistical guidance to authors at top-ranked scientific journals:
A cross-disciplinary assessment

This codebook documents the datasets data_all.csv and data_all.rds
The contents of these two datasets is the same - we are sharing in two formats so users can choose whether to use the csv file or the rds file as they prefer.

Description: This dataset contains preprocessed data for Study One data extraction/classification, information about journals included in the sample and the location of preserved statistical guidance. It consolidates primary data files data_coding.csv and data_journals.csv, but retains only the consensus coding (primary and secondary coding are not used in the analyses). There is therefore a single row for each of the 330 journals in the sample.

Source: Consolidated, filtered, and preprocessed version of primary data files data_coding.csv and data_journals.csv via the script preprocessing.R

Explanation of columns: 

coder: initials of the two authors assigned to code this journal
Journal: journal name

has_guidance: whether the journal has (TRUE) or does not have (FALSE) any statistical guidance
has_external_guidance: whether the journal refers to (TRUE) or does not refer to (FALSE) any statistical guidance in external sources	
external_guidance_raw: the external sources we originally extracted	
external_guidance_list: a cleaned up, homogenised version of external_guidance_raw		
has_internal_guidance: whether the journal has (TRUE) or does not have (FALSE) its own internal statistical guidance (in addition to any external guidance)	
has_internal_guidance_section: whether the journal has (TRUE) or does not have (FALSE) a dedicated statistical guidance section in its instructions to authors.

The next 40 columns pertain to the 20 prespecified statistical topics that we examined. The columns with the prefix has_ state whether the journal's guidance mentioned (TRUE) or did not mention (FALSE) a particular topic e.g., has_p_value states whether the guidance mentioned p-values. The columns without the has_ prefix contain the verbatim extracted guidance on that particular topic.

has_publisher_guidance: whether the journal does (TRUE) or does not (FALSE) share any publisher-level guidance	
publisher_guidance: the publisher guidance that the journal shares, either Nature, Cell, or Frontiers (or NA if the journal does not share publisher-level guidance).

overall_rank: The journal's overall rank, based on 2017 Journal Impact Factor
field_rank: The journal's domain rank, based on 2017 Journal Impact Factor
journal_impact_factor: Journal Impact Factor	 
esi_field: The scientific domain assigned to the journal by Essential Science Indicators
journalHomepage: The homepage of the journal's website
originalLink_statGuidance: A link to statistical guidance we identified on the journal webpage. NA = no guidance was found
permaLink_statGuidance: Link(s) to the preserved version of the journal webpage(s) / statistical guidance on perma.cc, web archive, or OSF. NA no guidance could be found.
notes: notes from the triage team about where exact statistical guidance can be found in the preserved documents, or highlighting any issues.
