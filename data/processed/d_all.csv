Screening covariates

Approaches that select factors for inclusion in a multivariable model only if the factors are “statistically significant” in “bivariate screening” are not optimal. A factor can be a confounder even if it is not statistically significant by itself because it changes the effect of the exposure of interest when it is included in the model, or because it is a confounder only when included with other covariates.

If several risk factors for disease are considered in a logistic regression model and some of these risk factors are measured with error, the point and interval estimates of relative risk corresponding to any of these factors may be biased either toward or away from the null value; the direction of bias is never certain. In addition to potentially biased estimates, confidence intervals of correctly adjusted estimates will be wider, sometime substantially, than naïve confidence intervals.

Authors should report results for meaningful metrics rather than reporting raw results. For example, rather than reporting the log odds ratio from a logistic regression, authors should transform coefficients into the appropriate measure of effect size, odds ratio, relative risk, or risk difference. Estimates, such as an odds ratio or relative risk, should not be reported for a 1-unit change in the factor of interest if a 1-unit change lacks clinical meaning (age, mm Hg of blood pressure, or any other continuous or interval measurement with small units). All estimates should reflect a clinically meaningful change, along with 95% confidence bounds.

Odds ratios and predicted probabilities

Authors often report odds ratios for multivariable results when the odds ratio is difficult to interpret or not meaningful. First, the odds ratio might overstate the effect size when the reference risk is high. For example, if the reference risk is 25% (odds = 0.33) and the odds ratio is 3.0, the relative risk is only 2.0. Statements such as “3-fold increased risk” or “3 times the risk” are incorrect. Second, readers want an easily understood measure of the level of risk (and the confidence intervals) for different groups of patients as defined by treatment, exposure, and covariates. Consider providing a table of predicted probabilities for each of the factors of interest, and confidence intervals of those predicted probabilities. Moreover, a multiway table that cross-classifies predicted probabilities by the most important factor and then adjusts for the remaining factors will often be more meaningful than a table of adjusted odds ratios. Standard commercial software can produce predicted probabilities and confidence bounds.

Hazard Ratios and Standardized Cumulative Incidence

Authors often report results from analysis of survival or time-to-event data using hazard ratios estimated from proportional hazards Cox models. Hazard ratios are notoriously difficult to interpret clinically, may be sensitive to the length of follow-up, and rely on model assumptions, such as proportional hazards. In addition, presenting estimates of effect in both absolute and relative terms increases the likelihood that results will be correctly interpreted. For all of these reasons, we recommend that authors present cumulative incidence curves (inverted Kaplan-Meier plots) along with tabular summaries of absolute differences in cumulative incidence, with 95% confidence bounds, at meaningful times, when reporting results from survival analyses. When such an analysis requires covariate adjustment, authors can estimate and present covariate-standardized (weighted) cumulative incidence curves with differences in adjusted cumulative incidence at meaningful times.

7. Sensitivity Analysis and Unmeasured Confounding

Analyses of observational data that attempt to assess causality between an exposure and an outcome are generally subject to confounding due to unmeasured or omitted covariates. In these settings, authors should carry out formal sensitivity analysis to assess how strong an unmeasured confounder would need to be to explain away an observed association. One relatively easy to use method that does not require strong assumptions is the E-value, proposed by VanderWeele and Ding (2017), an article that contains many references, includes a technical appendix, and points to available software. After conducting formal sensitivity, or bias analysis, authors can discuss the likelihood that the reported results are due to residual confounding.

Missing variables

Always report the frequency of missing variables and how the analysis handled missing data. Consider adding a column to tables or a row under figures that makes clear the amount of missing data. Avoid using a simple indicator or dummy variable to represent a missing value. Replacing missing predictors with dummy variables or missing indicators generally leads to biased estimates.

Missing Outcomes

Always report the frequency of missing outcomes and follow-up data, reasons and any patterns for the missing data, and how you handled missing data in the analyses. Do not use a last observation carried forward approach (LOCF) to address incomplete follow-up even if the original protocol prespecified that approach for handling missing data. LOCF approaches understate variability and result in bias. The direction of the bias is not predictable. Although the method of addressing missing data may have little import on findings when the proportion of missing data is small (e.g., <5%), authors should avoid using outdated or biased methods to address incomplete follow-up. Appropriate methods for handling missing data include imputation, pattern-mixture (mixed) models, and selection models. Application of these methods requires consideration of the patterns and potential mechanisms behind the missing data.

Proving significance of an association – even in a quite complicated model – does not imply causality of the relationship.

Statistical tests offer a rational decision in case of uncertainty. This probabilistic statement is possible only at the price of formality. If your descriptive analysis is in favour of your hypothesis, but the p-value is not significant, you could not prove your case and you should concede this. Even with a p-value 0.05

There are several points to consider:...

p-value is not significant: if the p-value does not reach significance, this is not proof that the scientific hypothesis is not correct. Other factors such as sample size, frequency of the given event or the relative effect size may explain the lack of statistical significance. Whenever a power calculation has been done, a probabilistic statement about the lack of effect can be made.

Significance vs. relevance: a statistically significant result does not imply clinical or scientific relevance even if the p-value is very low. This relevance is a subject-matter decision.

It is not necessary to state the exact level of p. @@@@ Statistical significance
The majority of papers published in BJP contain data sets
where several test groups are compared with a control
group in order to examine whether a drug has ‘an effect’.
In this context, statistics are used to inform a binary decision
about whether there is an effect or not. BJP continues
with the policy that authors must define what level of P
they consider to constitute statistical significance within
the Methods section of the paper. Authors may choose a
more stringent P threshold than the current norm of
P < 0.05, but this must not be changed from one part of a
manuscript to another.
Statistical analysis does not guarantee that a finding is
necessarily correct, and we will allow an author the right

be determined a priori such that an expected effect on the

For example,
normalization to matched controls will generate a control
mean of 1 and no SEM, meaning that parametric tests
(ANOVA, etc.) cannot be used (only non-parametric analysis
is acceptable). Any dataset where one group has no SEM
(common in Western blot analysis) must be analysed by
non-parametric statistics. Following data transformation,
the Y axis is often labelled incorrectly (it should be ‘fold
matched control values’ or ‘fold of the control mean’,
and not ‘fold control’).

FIGURE 2 CAPTION:
Parametric versus non-parametric. Individual data points (circles), mean values (x) and SEM values are shown. In panel A, two datasets derived
from an analysis (e.g. Western blotting) where each drug experiment included a matched (contemporaneous) control. A common practice is
for each drug value to be normalized to each matched control value. This means that the controlmean is 1, and there is no variance in the control.
The correct way to analyse these data is using a non-parametric statistical test, and the correct label for the Y axis is ‘fold matched control’. Because
analysis is non-parametric, it is misleading to show the parameter SEM. In panel B, each control and each drug value has been ‘normalized’ to the
mean value of the control group (mean values shown as x). In other words, each raw value has been divided by the value of the mean of the control
values. This generates a Gaussian dataset that can be analysed by parametric statistics (provided the variance is similar in the two groups - a ttest
may falsely identify a nonsignificant difference if the two SEM values differ greatly - see Figure 3), and if so, it is appropriate to show the SEM
(error bars in the figure). However, there is actually no benefit in making this transformation since the ratio between each mean and each SEM is
the same as the equivalent ratios for the raw data. In other words, this ‘transformation’ is identical to a relabelling or rescaling of the Y axis from the
absolute raw values to new values for which the control mean value is relabelled as ‘1’. This has no effect on the ability of the parametric statistical
test to detect a significant difference. However, readers have a tendency to make ‘eyeball’ comparisons between normalized datasets in the same
paper or indeed fromone paper to the next, and this may lead to false inferences. Thus, use of the normalization shown in panel A or presentation
of the raw data (in units that may be arbitrary if this is the case) is preferred, although we acknowledge that for quantitative PCR, the ‘transformation’
depicted in panel B represents common practice at the present time. We also remind authors to ensure that whatever normalization is chosen,
the Y axis is labelled correctly (fold control is not correct) and the appropriate type of statistical test is used.

These tests should be appropriate for the type (distribution) of data being analysed. Examples of such tests include Grubb’s or ROUT outlier tests. Where outliers are identified a clear indication of number of data points excluded must be provided with a robust explanation for the type of test used. @@@@ Outliers are data values that diverge from the central tendency. An outlier may be a rogue value or part of the innate data distribution. Several aspects of the data distribution may need to be considered before an investigator can decide how to deal with outliers. It is possible to define an outlier in a control population, but only if a large number of control values are available for evaluation. Outliers should therefore be included in data analysis and presentation unless a predefined and defensible set of exclusion criteria can be generated and applied. @@@@ Experimental outliers

We have introduced new guidelines on how to manage experimental outliers, which are defined as values that digress from the central tendency (or ‘central location’). There are several issues that need to be considered before an investigator can decide how to deal with outliers. First, how does one identify an outlier? With small group sizes (n < 12) this may be impossible. It is feasible to define an outlier in a control population as a value that lies outside a defined range, but only if the distribution of values is well defined. This requires a very large group size.

If it is possible to define an outlier, then the next question to address is: why is a value an outlier? The reason may be that the value is false, contaminated or in some other way incorrect. On the other hand, it may be correct, and the result of a natural wide spread of data, or even a bimodal distribution of data. The latter would arise, for example, if one were to analyse readouts in a population that expresses a polymorphism, such as a deficiency in acetylcholinesterase in a small section of the human population. Excluding such outlier values or subjects is justified only in an experiment defined to be relevant only to the larger population, for instance, in the acetylcholinesterase example, those with typical enzyme activity. It is therefore essential to know what the explanation is for an outlier, since it is inappropriate to exclude correct values just because they alter the data distribution.

Genuinely false values should be excluded from a sample, but this must be done using predefined criteria. Using a formula based on the standard deviation is one. A number of others are available in routinely used statistical packages, but their use can be problematic (Leys et al., 2013). Alternatively, one may use an arbitrary limit of acceptability (e.g. to exclude animals whose surgery has lowered blood pressure to below a value appropriate for testing drug effects especially, in this example, effects on blood pressure). This approach is acceptable to BJP, but exclusion criteria should be defined beforehand and applied on blinded data to avoid bias. Exclusion criteria should be fully described in Methods.

That practice leads to exaggerated estimates of effect size. Indeed, when statistical power is very low, only results that exaggerate the true size of an effect can be statistically significant. Therefore, it is typically not appropriate to base sample size solely on the sample sizes and/or effect sizes reported in prior research or on the results of small pilot studies (see, e.g., Gelman & Carlin, 2014).

If an estimate of the size of an effect is given, the unit of measurement (e.g., Cohen’s d) must be specified and some rationale for believing that the estimate is sound must be provided. If the study tests more than one effect, authors must make clear which of those effects their power analysis was based upon.",TRUE,"Psychological Science recommends the use of the “new statistics”—effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis—to avoid problems associated with null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST)...
