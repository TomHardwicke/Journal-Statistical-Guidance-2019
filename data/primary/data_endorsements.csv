Screening covariates

Approaches that select factors for inclusion in a multivariable model only if the factors are “statistically significant” in “bivariate screening” are not optimal. A factor can be a confounder even if it is not statistically significant by itself because it changes the effect of the exposure of interest when it is included in the model, or because it is a confounder only when included with other covariates.

If several risk factors for disease are considered in a logistic regression model and some of these risk factors are measured with error, the point and interval estimates of relative risk corresponding to any of these factors may be biased either toward or away from the null value; the direction of bias is never certain. In addition to potentially biased estimates, confidence intervals of correctly adjusted estimates will be wider, sometime substantially, than naïve confidence intervals.

Authors should report results for meaningful metrics rather than reporting raw results. For example, rather than reporting the log odds ratio from a logistic regression, authors should transform coefficients into the appropriate measure of effect size, odds ratio, relative risk, or risk difference. Estimates, such as an odds ratio or relative risk, should not be reported for a 1-unit change in the factor of interest if a 1-unit change lacks clinical meaning (age, mm Hg of blood pressure, or any other continuous or interval measurement with small units). All estimates should reflect a clinically meaningful change, along with 95% confidence bounds.

Odds ratios and predicted probabilities

Authors often report odds ratios for multivariable results when the odds ratio is difficult to interpret or not meaningful. First, the odds ratio might overstate the effect size when the reference risk is high. For example, if the reference risk is 25% (odds = 0.33) and the odds ratio is 3.0, the relative risk is only 2.0. Statements such as “3-fold increased risk” or “3 times the risk” are incorrect. Second, readers want an easily understood measure of the level of risk (and the confidence intervals) for different groups of patients as defined by treatment, exposure, and covariates. Consider providing a table of predicted probabilities for each of the factors of interest, and confidence intervals of those predicted probabilities. Moreover, a multiway table that cross-classifies predicted probabilities by the most important factor and then adjusts for the remaining factors will often be more meaningful than a table of adjusted odds ratios. Standard commercial software can produce predicted probabilities and confidence bounds.

Hazard Ratios and Standardized Cumulative Incidence

Authors often report results from analysis of survival or time-to-event data using hazard ratios estimated from proportional hazards Cox models. Hazard ratios are notoriously difficult to interpret clinically, may be sensitive to the length of follow-up, and rely on model assumptions, such as proportional hazards. In addition, presenting estimates of effect in both absolute and relative terms increases the likelihood that results will be correctly interpreted. For all of these reasons, we recommend that authors present cumulative incidence curves (inverted Kaplan-Meier plots) along with tabular summaries of absolute differences in cumulative incidence, with 95% confidence bounds, at meaningful times, when reporting results from survival analyses. When such an analysis requires covariate adjustment, authors can estimate and present covariate-standardized (weighted) cumulative incidence curves with differences in adjusted cumulative incidence at meaningful times.

Guidelines for Reporting fMRI Data
...We recognize that the focus of fMRI analyses is often not on effect sizes, but rather on (a) statistical reliability and (b) replicability. We refer authors to Poldrack et al. (2008) for a useful list of reporting guidelines for such analyses.

Over the past 50 years, many psychologists have conducted large numbers of studies with low statistical power and submitted for publication those studies that obtained statistically significant results (Cohen, 1969). That practice leads to exaggerated estimates of effect size. Indeed, when statistical power is very low, only results that exaggerate the true size of an effect can be statistically significant. Therefore, it is typically not appropriate to base sample size solely on the sample sizes and/or effect sizes reported in prior research or on the results of small pilot studies (see, e.g., Gelman & Carlin, 2014).
",Explicit endorsement,No guidance,"Submitting authors are also asked to explain why they believe that the sample sizes in the studies they report were appropriate. Bakker et al. (2016) reported evidence that many published research psychologists have faulty intuitions regarding statistical power.

There is no single right answer to this question, but authors must explain (in the submission portal and in the manuscript) why they believe their sample size is appropriate. If an estimate of the size of an effect is given, the unit of measurement (e.g., Cohen’s d) must be specified and some rationale for believing that the estimate is sound must be provided.

Statistical significance and biological significance are notthe same. There is nothing magical about a P value of 0.05.

Proving significance of an association – even in a quite complicated model – does not imply causality of the relationship.

Statistical tests offer a rational decision in case of uncertainty. This probabilistic statement is possible only at the price of formality. If your descriptive analysis is in favour of your hypothesis, but the p-value is not significant, you could not prove your case and you should concede this. Even with a p-value 0.05

There are several points to consider:...

p-value is not significant: if the p-value does not reach significance, this is not proof that the scientific hypothesis is not correct. Other factors such as sample size, frequency of the given event or the relative effect size may explain the lack of statistical significance. Whenever a power calculation has been done, a probabilistic statement about the lack of effect can be made.

Significance vs. relevance: a statistically significant result does not imply clinical or scientific relevance even if the p-value is very low. This relevance is a subject-matter decision.

JAMA Psychiatry,PSYCHIATRY_PSYCHOLOGY,"When possible, present numerical results (eg, absolute numbers and/or rates) with appropriate indicators of uncertainty, such as confidence intervals. Use means and standard deviations (SDs) for normally distributed data and medians and ranges or interquartile ranges (IQRs) for data that are not normally distributed. Avoid solely reporting the results of statistical hypothesis testing, such as P values, which fail to convey important quantitative information. For most studies, P values should follow the reporting of comparisons of absolute numbers or rates and measures of uncertainty (eg, 0.8%, 95% CI −0.2% to 1.8%; P = .13). P values should never be presented alone without the data that are being compared. If P values are reported, follow standard conventions for decimal places: for P values less than .001, report as ""P<.001""; for P values between .001 and .01, report the value to the nearest thousandth; for P values greater than or equal to .01, report the value to the nearest hundredth; and for P values greater than .99, report as ""P>.99."" For studies with exponentially small P values (eg, genetic association studies), P values may be reported with exponents (eg, P = 1×10−5). In general, there is no need to present the values of test statistics (eg, F statistics or χ² results) and degrees of freedom when reporting results.
@@@
For randomized trials using parallel-group design, there is no validity in conducting hypothesis tests regarding the distribution of baseline covariates between groups; by definition, these differences are due to chance. Because of this, tables of baseline participant characteristics should not include P values or statements of statistical comparisons among randomized groups. Instead, report clinically meaningful imbalances between groups, along with potential adjustments for those imbalances in multivariable models.

Studies on genomic selection generally require sample sizes of N > 200 and precise information about the structure of the population due to relatedness and/or ancestral structure. Likewise, adequate marker densities are required depending on the state-of-the-art for the respective species. Deviations from these rules are possible in well-justified cases to be explained in the cover letter.",Implicit endorsement,NA,No guidance
